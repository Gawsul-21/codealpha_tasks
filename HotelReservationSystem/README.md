Hotel Reservation System
Project Overview

This is a simple Java-based hotel reservation system that allows users to:

    Search for available rooms by type

    Make room reservations by entering guest details and stay duration

    View existing reservations by guest name

    Track room availability and payment status

The system uses basic Java features with multiple classes for managing rooms and bookings. It simulates core hotel reservation functionality via a console interface.
Features

    Room categorization: Single, Double, Suite

    Room availability management

    Reservation creation and payment status tracking

    User-friendly console menu
